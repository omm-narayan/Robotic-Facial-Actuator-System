# Robotic Head Control System

An expressive robotic head designed for research, prototyping, and interactive applications. Powered by Raspberry Pi Pico boards and controlled via a PySide6 desktop interface, this system simulates human-like facial expressions through precise servo control.


## Features

- Modular architecture: separate controllers for mouth, brows, and eyes
- 25+ servo-driven actuators for jaw, lips, tongue, eyelids, eyebrows, and eye movement
- MicroPython-based firmware for each module
- PySide6-based control panel with serial communication
- Easy-to-follow circuit diagrams and pin assignments


## Hardware Overview

- Microcontrollers: 3Ã— Raspberry Pi Pico (MicroPython)
- Servos: Over 25 PWM-controlled micro servos
- Power: Regulated 5V power supply for servo stability
- Pin mapping for each module board
